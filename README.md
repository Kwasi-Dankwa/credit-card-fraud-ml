# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling severe class imbalance, and evaluating multiple classification algorithms. The goal is to build models that can accurately identify fraud while minimizing false positives. It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

## Dataset and Insights

The [`dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

* Class Imbalance: Only 17.3% of transactions are fraudulent â€” a serious imbalance that can bias models toward predicting the majority class.

* Feature Distributions:

* The Class histogram shows an extreme skew toward legitimate transactions (0) vs fraudulent (1).

* PCA-transformed features (V1â€“V28) are mostly centered around zero with varying skewness.

* Time, V4, and Amount have wider and more varied distributions.

* Data Quality: No missing values found.

* Imbalance Solution: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to generate synthetic fraudulent samples for balanced training.

## ðŸ›  Methodology
EDA: Visualized class imbalance and feature distributions.

Preprocessing: Scaled features, split into training/testing sets.

Balancing: Used SMOTE to equalize class representation.

Modeling: Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.

Evaluation: Compared performance using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure balanced detection performance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Selection and Performance

### Reason for Model Choices

* Logistic Regression: Its a simple, fast, and highly interpretable baseline model and a great starting point to understand the basic relationships between your features and the target variable.

* Decision Tree: Its a non-linear model that is good at capturing complex, rule-based patterns. It's useful for finding specific combinations of features that may indicate fraud.

* Random Forest: This is an ensemble model that combines many Decision Trees. It's known for its high accuracy and ability to reduce overfitting. It's a powerful and robust choice for this kind of classification problem.

* XGBoost: A state-of-the-art Gradient Boosting model known for its performance and speed. It's highly effective for imbalanced datasets and is often a top performer in competition. This makes it essential to understand how it can optimize this specific problem

| Model                     | Precision | Recall  | F1 Score |
|---------------------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Logistic Regression**   | 0.8906    | 0.6264  | 0.7355   |
| **Decision Tree**         | 0.6566    | 0.7143  | 0.6842   |
| **Random Forest**         | 0.9189    | 0.7473  | 0.8242   |
| **XGBoost**               | 0.8784    | 0.7143  | 0.7879   |


Key Takeaways:

* Random Forest delivered the highest F1-score (0.8242), offering a strong balance between precision and recall.

* Logistic Regression maintained high precision but lower recall, meaning it caught fewer fraudulent cases.

* Decision Tree underperformed compared to ensemble methods.

* XGBoost was competitive with Random Forest, showing strong precision-recall trade-offs.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
Addressing class imbalance is crucial in fraud detection.

Ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost outperform single learners for this dataset.

SMOTE significantly improved recall for all models.
